<p>The <b>chicken</b>

</p> 
    

    (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. 

<p>
Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period
 (4th–2nd centuries BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,
 up from more than 19 billion in 2011.
